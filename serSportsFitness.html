            <h3 class="text-danger text-center">Weight-Lifting</h3>
            <p><b class="text-danger">Weight-Lifting</b> is a type of strength training using weights for resistance. By creating a stress to the muscles performed with free weights (e.g. barbells and dumbbells) or by using weight machines, these exercises
                will enable muscles to be activated and get stronger.</p>

            <p><b class="text-success">Body-Lifting</b> is an art form of using your own bodyweight as a means to maximize human power and athletic ability. With compound exercises, that is why multiple muscle groups are worked on all at once , employ a
                wide variety of muscle groups and the stability muscles that keep the body moving smoothly.</p>

            <p><b class="text-success">You can build serious strength.</b> You might be thinking: "How, if you're not hoisting barbells or dumbbells?" But you can accomplish a lot using just your own bodyweight, says Calabrese. If you're a 150-lb woman doing
                a bodyweight pull-up, you're effectively lifting 150 lbs.</p>
