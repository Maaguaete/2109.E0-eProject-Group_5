            <h6><i class='fas fa-life-ring swimCourse' style="font-size: xx-large;"></i> SURVIVAL SKILL</h6>
            <p>Unlike other sports, swimming is considered a necessity because it is a life-saving skill. Knowing how to swim and being a strong swimmer can give you peace of mind to enjoy everyday summer activities while still using caution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 text-justify">
            <h6><i class='fas fa-dumbbell swimCourse' style="font-size: xx-large;"></i> GAINING STRENGTH</h6>
            <p>People, who regularly swim, usually develop lean muscles and gain muscle strength throughout their body. This is one of the biggest benefits of swimming in relation to health. Running merely helps you to develop muscles in your legs, while
                swimming uses more muscle groups, which helps to improve overall muscle strength. Swimming, not only offers benefits of cardiovascular exercises, but also gives you a full body workout that helps you to build lean muscles and strengthen
                your body.

            <p>The average human has a resting heart rate of approximately 60 – 70 beats per minute. Most athletes, however, have a resting heart rate as low as 40 – 60 beats per minute. The heart is a muscle, and, like every other muscle in the body, you
                can train and strengthen it. This means that your heart pumps more blood with each beat, making it more efficient at supplying blood to the body. The health benefit of a lower resting heart rate is that you are at less risk of heart disease.

            offering little respite from the day’s activities leading to more and more fatigue. By swimming, you could offer your body a natural way to decompress from the day and prepare for rest.

            makes us smarter is its effect of improving our memory. A part of our brain consists of the hippocampus, which is a fundamental component of our brain’s learning and memory systems.

            living less satisfying lives and sleeping less and less. To address your increased levels of tension, you can increase your exercise. Physical activity releases endorphins which are a natural way to reduce stressors.
